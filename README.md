# SmartFoodwarehouse
Automated robot system to convert a food warehouse into a fully automated storage and retrieval system
# ü§ñ Automated Food Warehouse Robot Project üè≠

## 1. Algorithm for Implementation üìù

1. Initialize the robot system and establish connection with warehouse management software.  
2. Receive commands to store or retrieve food items.  
3. For storing:  
   - Identify available storage location in the warehouse database.  
   - Navigate robot to the location avoiding obstacles using sensors.  
   - Use robotic arm to place the item accurately.  
   - Update inventory database with the new location.  
4. For retrieving:  
   - Locate the requested item from the database.  
   - Navigate to the item's location safely.  
   - Use robotic arm to pick the item.  
   - Deliver item to the designated dispatch area.  
   - Update inventory database accordingly.  
5. Continuously monitor environment with sensors for obstacle avoidance and safety.  
6. Handle errors or obstacles by sending alerts for human intervention if needed.  
7. Return robot to standby position and wait for next command.  
8. Shutdown system safely upon request.

## 2. Robot Design ü§ñ

- Mobile base: Wheeled platform for navigation inside the warehouse.  
- Robotic arm: At least 4 degrees of freedom for precise picking and placing of items.  
- Sensors:  
  - LIDAR or ultrasonic sensors for distance measurement and obstacle detection.  
  - Optional camera for item recognition and location verification.  
- Control unit: Microcontroller or single-board computer (e.g., Arduino, Raspberry Pi).  
- Navigation system: Indoor localization with maps or markers to guide robot efficiently.  
- Communication: Wireless connection to warehouse management system (Wi-Fi or Bluetooth).

## 3. Working Envelope Elements üìê

- Warehouse dimensions: Length, width, and height of the storage area.  
- Robot mobility range: Maximum distance and turning radius of the mobile base.  
- Robotic arm reach: Maximum horizontal and vertical reach of the arm.  
- Storage zones: Designated shelving and pallet areas within the warehouse.  
- Navigation paths: Safe routes for the robot to move without collisions.  
- Obstacle zones: Areas to avoid due to fixed structures or dynamic obstacles.  
- Standby/charging stations: Locations for robot rest and battery recharge.
